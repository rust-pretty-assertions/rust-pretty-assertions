Overwrite `assert_eq!` with a drop-in replacement, adding a colorful diff.

## Usage

When writing tests in Rust, you'll probably use `assert_eq!(a, b)` _a lot_.

If such a test fails, it will present all the details of `a` and `b`.
But you have to spot the differences yourself, which is not always straightforward,
like here:

![standard assertion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-pretty-assertions/rust-pretty-assertions/2d2357ff56d22c51a86b2f1cfe6efcee9f5a8081/examples/standard_assertion.png)

Wouldn't that task be _much_ easier with a colorful diff?

![pretty assertion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-pretty-assertions/rust-pretty-assertions/2d2357ff56d22c51a86b2f1cfe6efcee9f5a8081/examples/pretty_assertion.png)

Yep â€” and you only need **one line of code** to make it happen:

```rust,ignore
use pretty_assertions::{assert_eq, assert_ne};
```

<details>
<summary>Show the example behind the screenshots above.</summary>

```rust,ignore
// 1. add the `pretty_assertions` dependency to `Cargo.toml`.
// 2. insert this line at the top of each module, as needed
use pretty_assertions::{assert_eq, assert_ne};

fn main() {
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
    struct Foo {
        lorem: &'static str,
        ipsum: u32,
        dolor: Result<String, String>,
    }

    let x = Some(Foo { lorem: "Hello World!", ipsum: 42, dolor: Ok("hey".to_string())});
    let y = Some(Foo { lorem: "Hello Wrold!", ipsum: 42, dolor: Ok("hey ho!".to_string())});

    assert_eq!(x, y);
}
```

</details>

## Semantic Versioning

The exact output of assertions is **not guaranteed** to be consistent over time, and may change between minor versions.
The output of this crate is designed to be read by a human. It is not suitable for exact comparison, for example in snapshot testing.

This crate adheres to semantic versioning for publically exported crate items, **except** the `private` module, which may change between any version.

## Tip

Specify it as [`[dev-dependencies]`](http://doc.crates.io/specifying-dependencies.html#development-dependencies)
and it will only be used for compiling tests, examples, and benchmarks.
This way the compile time of `cargo build` won't be affected!

Also add `#[cfg(test)]` to your `use` statements, like this:

```rust,ignore
#[cfg(test)]
use pretty_assertions::{assert_eq, assert_ne};
```

If you want to enforce usage of `pretty_assertions` macros over `std`, add the following to `clippy.toml`:

```rs
disallowed-macros = [
  { path = "std::assert_ne", reason = "use `pretty_assertions::assert_ne` instead" },
  { path = "std::assert_eq", reason = "use `pretty_assertions::assert_eq` instead" },
  { path = "std::assert_matches", reason = "use `pretty_assertions::assert_matches` instead" },
]
```

## Notes

- Since `Rust 2018` edition, you need to declare
  `use pretty_assertions::{assert_eq, assert_ne};` per module.
  Before you would write `#[macro_use] extern crate pretty_assertions;`.
- The replacement is only effective in your own crate, not in other libraries
  you include.
- `assert_ne` is also switched to multi-line presentation, but does _not_ show
  a diff.
- Under Windows, the terminal state is modified to properly handle VT100
  escape sequences, which may break display for certain use cases.
- The minimum supported rust version (MSRV) is 1.35.0

### `no_std` support

For `no_std` support, disable the `std` feature and enable the `alloc` feature:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
pretty_assertions = { version= "...", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }
```
